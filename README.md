# Ptero discord bot client.

###### *P.S. someone please join my server and give me a better name for this, thanks. (https://discord.gg/kafECFAgpF)*

This bot uses the Pterodactyl Client api using the API key to manage a server using the ID and the CLient API provided by you that should be specified in the `.env` file.


This bot is built of nextcord and will be improved (it was made in 1 day as a quick project so sorry for spaghetti code) over time. This is currently hardcoded but will be made better so do NOT worry about that. A very flexible bot should arrive late 2024, early 2025 which allows for account creation, server creation etc etc.

Thanks and sorry for this low, unprofessional code
